In an effort to promote collaboration on analytical projects and facilitate code replicability, we've developed R Packages and encourage the use of git / github as a version control tool. These packages are primarily used to optimize work flows for USAID South Africa, particularly as it relates to data management and processing.

# [TierDrop](https://usaid-sa-si.github.io/tierdrop/) <img src="https://github.com/USAID-SA-SI/tierdrop/raw/main/man/figures/logo.png" target="_blank" align="right" height="200" />

TierDrop is a package to process, validate, and consolidate MER data from 2 primary data sources (TIER data from the National Department of Health (NDoH) and non-TIER data reported from implementing partners) for import to DATIM for USAID South Africa.

This package will allow users to tidy and process data from NDoH into a DATIM import file, consolidate TIER and non-TIER files, and run verification checks to build the Data Quality Reporting Trackers (DQRT).
